### What is this?
This is the documentation for my complete [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)  system bundled with all dependencies declaratively with the [Nix Package Manager](https://nixos.org/).

This documentation was written in the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) notes taking app and as such my configuration for the vault is also included with this documentation. These documents are hosted with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).
